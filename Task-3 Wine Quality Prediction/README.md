# 🍷 Task-3: Wine Quality Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Predict the quality of red wine using machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Wine Quality Dataset - UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- Contains 11 features + 1 target (`quality`)

## 🧪 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## ✅ Results
| Model              | Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 57.5%   |
| Random Forest       | 67.8%   |

## 📈 Visualizations
- Correlation heatmap
- Countplots
- Pairplots
- Feature distributions

## 💡 Conclusion
Random Forest performed better. Logistic Regression struggled due to multi-class imbalance.
