# 🌸 Task 2 – Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of the **CodSoft Internship (July 2025 Batch)**.  
The goal is to classify iris flower species using supervised machine learning models.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a classification model that can predict the **species of an iris flower** based on its features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

---

## 📂 Dataset

The [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) is a classic dataset included in scikit-learn.  
It contains **150 samples** from three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for modeling)

---

## 📊 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

- Class distribution
- Pairplots and Boxplots
- Violin plot of petal length
- Correlation heatmap

---

## 🧠 Models Used

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**

✅ Both models achieved excellent accuracy with the Iris dataset.

---

## ✅ Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

---

## 💡 Result

Both models performed with **100% accuracy** on the test set.  
This demonstrates the dataset is well-separated and ideal for classification.

## 🔮 Live Input Demo

Example prediction using user input:

```text
Enter flower measurements to predict species:

Sepal length (cm):  3.0
Sepal width  (cm):  2.5
Petal length (cm):  1.5
Petal width  (cm):  2.0

🌼 Predicted species: Setosa
