# Task 1 - Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

## 📌 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using classification algorithms.

## 📂 Dataset
- [Titanic Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Colab

## 📊 Steps Performed
1. Data Loading
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
6. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

## 📌 Outcome
The model predicts survival with a high accuracy using meaningful features like Age, Pclass, and Sex.
